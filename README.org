* BjoStorageSolution

This project's purpose is to help assembling normalized archives for data associated with chemical entities.

It is using Python >=3.8 (not tested with earlier versions).

You will have to intall openbabel and the openbabel python library. This will depend on the platform you are using.
There is not much ways around that as openbabel 3.0.0 is not yet available on PyPi.

It also means, it will not work with virtualenvironment that do not have site packages.
